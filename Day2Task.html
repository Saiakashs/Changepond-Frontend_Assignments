        <h2>Petra, Jordan</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/1_petra_jordan.jpeg" alt="Great Wall of China" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>We had visited many ancient cities before we made our way to Petra. We thought we had seen it all until we walked through the 1.2 km-long Aiq (a narrow gorge with high rock walls reaching 80 meters into the air) leading to the incredible Treasury building. The journey was beautiful, but once we arrived at the opening in the middle of a canyon, we gasped in awe. This archaeological site was hidden from the outside world for centuries. <br>


            It is believed that Petra was built 2000 years ago by the Nabateans who lived in the Wadi Musa Valley. An earthquake in the 2nd century damaged it and fell into ruin. <br>
            
            It wasn’t until 1812 that it was “discovered” by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Also known as the Rose City and the Lost City, Petra has become Jordan’s premier tourist attraction.</p>

        <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/2_wall_china.jpg" alt="Great Wall of China" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>We have had the privilege of visiting The Great Wall of China, not once but twice! We have been to two sections: the Mutianyu Wall and the Badaling Great Wall. Both were equally impressive. We really feel that the Great Wall of China lives up to the hype. The location is breathtaking as it weaves through the mountains and spans for miles and miles. Even with the crowds of Badaling, which is close to Beijing, we loved it. The wall was built in the 7th century and spanned nearly 9000 km.</p>

        <h2>Christ the Redeemer, Brazil</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/3_christ_redeemer_brazil.jpg" alt="Christ the Redeemer, Brazil" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Rio de Janeiro is one of our favorite cities on earth. The Christ the Redeemer statue stands proudly overhead high on Corcovado Mountain, overlooking the city, and can be seen from all vantage points. The most amazing experience we had was taking a doors-off helicopter ride to view Christ the Redeemer from above. The statue of Jesus perched on Mount Corcovado began construction in 1926. Standing 30 meters tall, it is a massive achievement and has made Rio one of the most popular tourist destinations on the planet.</p>

        <p>It has always been our dream to see the Colosseum of Italy. When we finally made it to Rome, we not only had the chance to see it, but we stayed in the most incredible apartment right beside this wonder with a view of the ruins from our window. Built-in the 1st century, this amphitheater has a bloody past with Gladiators fighting to the death and Christians being thrown to the lions. Animals were used and abused here, and it is thought that half a million people and nearly one million animals died within its walls. Today, it stands in ruins and no longer sees bloodshed. Instead, it sees many tourists, with more than 6 million people visiting it each year!</p>

        <h2>Machu Pichu, Peru</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/5_machu_pichu_peru.jpeg" alt="Machu Pichu, Peru" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>When we first arrived at Machu Picchu in Peru, it was shrouded in clouds. I’ll never forget      Dave’s dejected look. It was our one and only time visiting this wonder of the world, and we weren’t going to see it! Luckily, as the morning progressed, the heavens opened up, and we witnessed the awe-inspiring sight of this ancient city high in the Andes mountains. <br>


            Often referred to as the “Lost City of the Incas,” Machu Picchu is one of the most iconic and celebrated sites globally and was designated as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007. This ancient city is perched high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, at an altitude of about 2,430 meters (7,970 feet) above sea level, overlooking the Urubamba River valley. <br>
            
            Discovered by the Western world in 1911, the Incan City is believed to have been inhabited in the 1600s. Machu Picchu deserves to be on this list with its impressive location. Located at an altitude of 2400 meters, the city’s terraces plunge into the valley below. How they built these structures on the side of a mountain hundreds of years ago is beyond my comprehension, but seeing it today will blow you away. <br>

        <h2>Chichen Itza, Mexico</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/6_chichen_itza_mexico.jpg" alt="Chichen Itza, Mexico" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>Chichen Itza was the first of the new wonders of the world that Dave and I ever visited. In fact, our trip to Mexico in 1999 was one of the first international trips we ever took together. I’ll never forget a friend telling us to go, and I am glad we listened. Back then, you could still walk up the ancient pyramid, and it was harrowing. <br>
        
            We understood why they closed it to tourists; it was steep and scary, but it was also an experience we’ll never forget. The Mayan City of Chichén Itzá was the center of the Maya Civilization. It is located in the Yucatan Peninsula and dates back to the 9th century. The pyramid at Chichen Itza has four sides, each with 91 steps, making a total of 365 steps, and a platform dedicated to Venus. It is closely tied to astronomy, with buildings precisely made to coincide with the spring and winter equinoxes.</p>

        <h2>Taj Mahal, India</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/7_taj_mahal_india.jpeg" alt="Taj Mahal, India" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p>The Taj Mahal in India was our least favorite of all the new seven wonders to visit, but it is still impressive. We actually never wrote about our time there as we didn’t love Agra or the Taj. Obviously, many people disagree with us as it was named one of the seven. The Taj Mahal is considered one of the finest examples of Mughal Architecture, with its beautiful white marble walls that change color depending on the time of day. It is also considered to be a beautiful love story as it was completed in 1658 by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who built it for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. She died in 1631, just three years after he began construction, but he continued on to honor her memory. <br>
        
            The Taj Mahal is beautiful, and we stood in line early in the morning to be the first people in. We quickly grabbed the iconic shot at the reflecting pool before running around frantically, staying ahead of the crowds to see it without the masses. I’d like to go back to give it a second chance. Perhaps I would fall in love with it as so many others have.</p>
